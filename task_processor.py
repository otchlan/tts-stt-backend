def parse_project_tasks_from_transcription(transcribed_text: str):

    Parses out tasks from the transcribed text.
    
    - A project is indicated by a word that starts with '#'.
    - We capture everything after that hashtag until we see:

      - Or an end word: 'finish' or 'koniec'.
    - That captured text is a single "task" under that project.
